    <p>
        I am a software developer specialized in backend integrations, currently working in the TravelTech industry.  
        I’m passionate about building scalable solutions using .NET and C#, while continuously learning about APIs, automation, and cloud technologies.  
        This portfolio is a personal project designed to showcase my skills and growth as a developer.
    </p>

    @* <p class="k8s-section">
        This portfolio is also fully prepared to run on Kubernetes.  
        Although it is deployed through a traditional hosting provider, the project includes Kubernetes configuration files that allow the application to be deployed inside any Kubernetes cluster.  
        This setup demonstrates my ability to work with containerized applications, orchestration tools, and scalable cloud-native architectures.
        <br><br>
        To run this application on Kubernetes, simply apply the provided configuration files using:
        <br>
        <code>kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml</code><br>
        <code>kubectl apply -f service.yaml</code>
        <br><br>
        These files define the application's Docker image, replicas, and networking configuration, allowing the portfolio to run either locally using Minikube or on any cloud-based Kubernetes environment.
