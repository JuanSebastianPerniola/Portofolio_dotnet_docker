        <h3>Concepts and learnings about the .NET core</h3>
        <p>
            In this section, I document my learnings about the <strong>.NET core</strong>, including concepts,
            patterns, performance, memory, internal architecture, and best practices.
            This is a living space where I explain in a clear and practical way everything I discover as I evolve
            as a .NET developer.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>ThreadPool</strong>, tasks, and concurrent programming.</li>
            <li><strong>Garbage Collector</strong> and memory optimization.</li>
            <li><strong>Async/Await</strong> under the hood (state machines, synchronization context...).</li>
            <li><strong>Span&lt;T&gt;</strong>, <strong>Memory&lt;T&gt;</strong>, and performance-oriented structures.</li>
            <li><strong>Dependency Injection</strong> in .NET and its lifecycle.</li>
            <li><strong>Hosting Model</strong> and how a .NET app works internally.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            The goal is to offer a professional and in-depth view of the .NET ecosystem without needing
            to create a separate repository for every experiment.
